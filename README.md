# tag_tracking
ML based Motion Tracking and Synthetic MR Motion Image Generator

# Summary

`tagsim/` contains code used to generate motion images, and perform a Bloch
simulation to create MR images with proper contrast/features.

`torch_tag/` contains the pyTorch implementation of the tracking network and
code used to trian the network.

**Coming Soon**: Jupyter notebooks giving high-level demos of all of these function.
